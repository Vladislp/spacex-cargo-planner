## Known issues

- A lot of issues with the UI in all screen sizes.
- Functionality is mostly fine with minor issues.
- Styles are not encapsulated inside components.
- A lot of code duplication
- td elements are used instead of anchor tags which is not correct
- no a11y
- A lot of unnecessary state is used
- No tests
Pay attention to code quality - use React + TS best practices (I recommend checking this cheatsheet https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/setup)
